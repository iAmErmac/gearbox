## What Changed in VR Version?
* Since level freezing also locks up head-tracking so it is replaced by new codes to freeze all monsters and projectiles instead.
* Mouse control for the weapon wheel is replaced by joystick control (off-hand joystick).
* When weapon wheel is open the player movement is disabled.
* Option to make player invulnerable while the weapon wheel is open.
* Option to use Slow-Mo instead of freeze using Bullet-Time-X mod. Bullet-Time-X mod must be loaded before this mod.
* Weapon wheel description panel is replaced with onscreen messages when message option is enabled.

## How to Use

GZDoom 4.5 required.

1. open the menu by assigned key, or by next/previous weapon keys, if enabled in options
2. select the weapon with next/previous weapon keys, or with offhand controller joystick (wheel only)

## Features

- Different representations: blocks, wheel, plain text
- Press Fire key to select and Alt Fire key to cancel
- Color and scale options
- Behavior options
- Multiplayer compatible
- Reaction to number keys
- extras.wad icon support for vanilla weapons
- Inventory item selection

## Compatibility Issues

- [PyWeaponWheel VR](https://github.com/iAmErmac/PyWeaponWheel-VR)
  overrides time freezing/slow-mo/invulnerability. If you are using both mods and want to freeze time with Gearbox, set PyWeaponWheel's option "Freeze when wheel is open" (`py_weaponwheel_freeze` CVar) to Off.

  Note that PyWeaponWheel may be built in some mods, for example in Project Brutality. The solution is the same: disable time PyWeaponWheel's time freezing.

## Known Issues

- Weapon icons in wheel aren't affected by "HUD preserves aspect ration" option.
- Anything other than monsters and proectiles will not freeze when the weapon wheel is open including decorative actors, ACS scripts and platforms/lifts.
- There are some inherent bugs associated with the new freezing system where a projectile can still be fired (eg. rocket or bfg) when player and monsters are frozen and the hitting projectile may push away monsters infinitely or make them come alive.
- When loaded after Bullet-Time-X but slow-mo not enabled, opening the weapon wheel will reset adrenaline for Bullet Time. In that case use an alternate slow-mo mod like [SlomoBulletTime Ultimate](https://www.moddb.com/addons/slomobullettime-ultimate-r3)

## Planned

- Patches for weapon icon adjustments
- More representations
- Moving weapon between slots and changing order

## Note for Weapon Mod Authors

If you want Gearbox to support your mod out of the box, assign
Inventory.AltHudIcon for your weapons! Tag property is also nice to have.
